# Bomberman3D

School project made at EPITECH at the end of second year.

The code is sometime messy for 3 reasons :
- It was our first big object-oriented project.
- Our first experience with 3D engine 
- We didn't had much time to make it

Well at least we had the 2nd best note of the promotion !

Lib used :
- Irrlicht (mandatory)
- XEffects, an Irrlicht add-on (for the shadow map)
- SFML (only the audio module, for the sound/music)

Compilation worked on Manjaro, Ubuntu, OpenSuse
We also made a Windows version, but github don't want big files.
If you have some errors with the compilation, don't hesitate to recompile SFML or Irrlicht (make irrlicht, make sfml, etc).
