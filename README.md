![alt tag](https://github.com/parigi-n/Bomberman3D/blob/master/media/battlefest_logo.png?raw=true)

School project made at EPITECH at the end of second year.

Authors :

- Nicolas PARIGI https://github.com/parigi-n for for the 3D rendering, collision model, sound module, some part of the gameplay
- David SEBAOUN https://github.com/david-sebaoun for the build system and AI
- Martin PELLEMOINE https://github.com/pellem for the animation of the 3d model and the winning screen/leaderboard
- Hubert WROBLEWSKI https://github.com/huski1017 for all the menu : the front part and the back part.
- Jules VAUTIER https://github.com/JulesVautier for the map generation, AI action module and some parts of the gameplay.
- Oscar, for ... well i don't know

The code is sometime messy for 3 reasons :
- It was our first big object-oriented project.
- Our first experience with 3D engine 
- We didn't had much time to make it

Well at least we had the 2nd best note of the promotion !

Lib used :
- Irrlicht (mandatory)
- XEffects, an Irrlicht add-on (for the shadow map)
- SFML (only the audio module, for the sound/music)

Compilation worked on Manjaro, Ubuntu, OpenSuse
We also made a Windows version, but github doesn't want big files.
If you have some errors with the compilation, don't hesitate to recompile SFML or Irrlicht (make irrlicht, make sfml, etc).
